In this folder you can find code to implement our example application: track and follow.
Our code is compatible with:
 - tensorflow object detection APIs
 - PixHawk flight controller
 - Python 3.x, compatibility with 2.7

There are several emergency procedures in place, however remember to always perform experiments with a backup controller to land if unsafe scenarios arise.
